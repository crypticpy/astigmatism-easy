# AstigmatismEasy Theme

A scientifically-optimized VS Code theme for developers with astigmatism and age-related vision decline. Available in **Night**, **Daylight**, and the new **Infrared** variant to support your entire coding workflow. The Night version is specifically designed for coding in low-light environments, especially beneficial for those wearing prismatic neuro lens glasses, the Daylight version provides enhanced visibility and comfort in brighter conditions, and the Infrared variant delivers an almost entirely red-shifted experience for ultra-low-light sessions.

## üåì Theme Variants

AstigmatismEasy now comes in three variants to support your entire coding workflow:

### Night Theme
Optimized for low-light environments, the Night theme preserves dark adaptation and minimizes halation effects that are particularly problematic for developers with astigmatism when working in the dark. It uses the original deep contrast and color calibrations ideal for minimal ambient light.

### Infrared Theme (NEW)
Designed for extremely low ambient light (think planetarium, observatory, or red-room conditions), the Infrared theme keeps the entire UI‚Äîchrome, diagnostics, and syntax‚Äîwithin carefully tuned reds, corals, and peaches. Key characteristics include:
- Deeper oxblood background (`#140707`) with softened transparency to maintain OLED smoothness without producing hard edges.
- Rose-beige body text (`#F2D6C9`) and a full syntax palette of crimson, salmon, and peach hues that stay legible without injecting blue light.
- Diagnostics, terminal colors, and focus states recast in ember tones so the whole workspace remains red-shifted for long sessions without disrupting dark adaptation.

### Daylight Theme
The Daylight theme adapts the core scientific principles for use in rooms with more ambient light while remaining a dark theme. It features:
- Slightly lighter backgrounds for surrounding UI elements (like the Sidebar and Status Bar) for better visual separation from the editor in brighter conditions.
- Increased opacity and/or brightness for many secondary text elements (e.g., inactive line numbers, inlay hints, muted UI text) to improve their legibility against more ambient light.
- Maintained warm color palette and core editor syntax highlighting to reduce eye strain, even in brighter settings.
- Optimized overall UI contrast for readability without introducing glare, ensuring the theme remains comfortable for extended periods.

## üî¨ The Science Behind These Themes

This theme is based on extensive vision science research and addresses several key aspects of how astigmatism and other vision considerations affect coding:

### Low-Light Vision & Dark Adaptation

When working in dark environments, your eyes rely more on rod cells (scotopic vision) rather than cone cells. Rods are more sensitive to light but don't perceive color as well, and they undergo the Purkinje shift ‚Äì becoming more sensitive to blue-green wavelengths as light dims. This is especially critical for the Night theme, but the principles of using warm colors and minimizing blue light benefit both variants by reducing overall eye strain.

**Our solution:**
- Uses predominantly warm colors (reds, oranges, yellows) for interface elements.
- Minimizes blue light that disrupts rhodopsin (the chemical responsible for night vision).
- Creates a balanced palette that preserves dark-adapted vision acuity (Night theme) and reduces general eye fatigue (both themes).

### Astigmatism, Contrast Sensitivity, and Glasses Wearers

Astigmatism causes light to focus unevenly, leading to blurred or ghosted vision. In dark conditions, pupils dilate, which can make astigmatic blur worse by highlighting corneal/lenticular imperfections. This often creates a "halation" effect where bright text on dark backgrounds blooms or halos. For developers wearing glasses, especially those with astigmatism or prismatic lenses, these effects can be compounded by glare, reflections off the lens surfaces, and chromatic aberration (color fringing).

**Our solution:**
- Uses a dark warm gray background (`#282828`) instead of pure black, and warm beige text (`#EBDBB2`) instead of stark white. This controlled, lower overall luminance reduces the intensity of light that can cause glare and reflections on glasses.
- Employs a warm color palette throughout, which can help minimize chromatic aberration (color fringing) that is sometimes more noticeable with certain lens coatings or prescriptions.
- Maintains optimal contrast ratios (typically 5:1 to 11:1) for all text elements, ensuring readability without excessive brightness that could exacerbate glare or halation.
- Avoids extreme contrast boundaries that worsen astigmatic haloing and can be particularly distracting when viewed through corrective lenses.

### Scientific Color Selection (Night & Daylight Editors)

Every color in these themes has been chosen based on vision science principles. The following table reflects the core syntax highlighting colors against the editor background, consistent across both Night and Daylight versions for the main coding area:

| Element  | Color   | Contrast (vs #282828) | Scientific Rationale                                                              |
|----------|---------|-----------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Background | #282828 | -                     | Dark enough for low luminance but not pure black to prevent halation/excessive glare |
| Text     | #EBDBB2 | 10.8:1                | Warm beige reduces blue component while maintaining readability                     |
| Keywords | #FB4934 | 7.5:1                 | Red has minimal impact on night vision while providing visual distinction           |
| Strings  | #8EC07C | 7.0:1                 | Green-teal is easier to focus than blue while remaining distinguishable           |
| Numbers  | #D3869B | 6.0:1                 | Desaturated purple provides contrast without excessive brightness                 |
| Comments | #BDAE93 | 6.3:1                 | Intentionally lower contrast for deemphasis while remaining legible & warm         |
### Infrared Variant Palette

The Infrared theme retains the same ergonomic philosophy while shifting every accent toward the red spectrum:

| Element  | Color   | Contrast (vs #140707) | Scientific Rationale |
|----------|---------|-----------------------|----------------------|
| Background | #140707 | - | Deep oxblood keeps luminance extremely low without going pitch black |
| Text     | #F2D6C9 | 14.3:1 | Rose-beige foreground keeps glyphs clear while avoiding blue components |
| Keywords | #FF6B6B | 7.1:1 | Crimson keywords provide emphasis without harsh saturation |
| Strings  | #FF9E80 | 9.8:1 | Salmon-peach strings preserve readability while staying in warm wavelengths |
| Numbers  | #F28CA5 | 8.5:1 | Dusty rose numerics separate literals without bright halos |
| Functions | #FFB4A2 | 11.6:1 | Peach-toned functions maintain hierarchy and strong contrast |
| Types    | #FF9780 | 9.4:1 | Coral types highlight structure while keeping the palette cohesive |
| Comments | #C69A92 | 7.9:1 | Muted clay comments stay legible yet comfortably subdued |
